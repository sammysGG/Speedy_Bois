    "You'll train an AI agent using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to control a car racing around a track. The model \"sees\" an image of the track, and learns to choose actions such as (turn left, turn right, accelerate, brake, or do nothing) to maximize its score.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Cells**: Blocks of code or text. Run them with `Shift + Enter` or click the ▶️ button\n",
    "- **Code cells**: Contain Python code you can execute\n",
    "- **Text cells**: Contain formatted text (like this README)\n",
    "- **Runtime**: The virtual computer running your code\n",
    "  - Go to `Runtime → Change runtime type` to select GPU\n",
    "  - Free GPUs speed up training significantly\n",
    "- **Session timeout**: After 12 hours or if idle, your runtime disconnects. Your code remains but variables reset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Shortcuts\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Shift + Enter`: Run current cell and move to next\n",
    "- `Ctrl + Enter`: Run current cell and stay on it\n",
    "- `Ctrl + S`: Save notebook\n",
    "- `Ctrl + /`: Comment/uncomment code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colab File System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files you create live in `/content/` directory\n",
    "- **Important**: Files are temporary! They disappear when runtime disconnects\n",
